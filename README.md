Indoors OS
Indoors OS is a minimalist, Windows-based operating system designed for users who prioritize efficiency, speed, and terminal-driven computing. It aims to provide a lightweight Windows experience with a focus on command-line interaction while still offering a graphical interface for those who prefer it.

Features
Minimal Installation: Ships with a bare minimum of preinstalled software, giving users full control over customization and avoiding unnecessary bloat.
Optimized Performance: Aims for fast and stable performance, with efficient use of system resources, tailored for a range of hardware capabilities. It is a de-bloated version of Windows, meaning it has been stripped of unnecessary features and services that can slow down the system.

Virtual Environment: Indoors OS tested in VirtualBox VM on a debloated Windows setup with 1GB RAM and 2 CPU cores allocated from main CPU.
